Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Moe's Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink.
Bart_Simpson: Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch.
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Hold on, I'll check. (TO BARFLIES) Mike Rotch. Mike Rotch. Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch, lately?
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Listen you little puke. One of these days I'm gonna catch you, and I'm gonna carve my name on your back with an ice pick.
Moe_Szyslak: What's the matter Homer? You're not your normal effervescent self.
Homer_Simpson: I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one.
Moe_Szyslak: Homer, hey, you should not drink to forget your problems.
Barney_Gumble: Yeah, you should only drink to enhance your social skills.


Moe_Szyslak: Ah, isn't that nice. Now, there is a politician who cares.
Barney_Gumble: If I ever vote, it'll be for him. (BELCH)


Barney_Gumble: Hey Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?
Homer_Simpson: Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place. (CHUCKLES)
Moe_Szyslak: (STRUGGLING WITH CORKSCREW) Crummy right-handed corkscrews! What does he sell?
Homer_Simpson: Uh, well actually, Moe...
HOMER_(CONT'D: I dunno.


Moe_Szyslak: Looks like this is the end.
Barney_Gumble: That's all right. I couldn't have led a richer life.
Barney_Gumble: So the next time somebody tells you county folk are good, honest people, you can spit in their faces for me!
Lisa_Simpson: I will, Mr. Gumbel. But if you'll excuse me, I'm profiling my dad for the school paper. I thought it would be neat to follow him around for a day to see what makes him tick.
Barney_Gumble: Oh, that's sweet. I used to follow my dad to a lot of bars too. (BELCH)
Moe_Szyslak: Here you go. One beer, one chocolate milk.
Lisa_Simpson: Uh, excuse me, I have the chocolate milk.
Moe_Szyslak: Oh.
Moe_Szyslak: What's the matter, Homer? The depressin' effects of alcohol usually don't kick in 'til closing time.
Lisa_Simpson: He's just a little nervous. (PROUDLY) He has to give a speech tomorrow on "How To Keep Cool In A Crisis."
Homer_Simpson: (SOBS) What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?
Barney_Gumble: Hey, I had to give a speech once. I was pretty nervous, so I used a little trick. I pictured everyone in their underwear. The judge, the jury, my lawyer, everybody.
Homer_Simpson: Did it work?
Barney_Gumble: I'm a free man, ain't I?
Barney_Gumble: Whoa!
Barney_Gumble: Huh? A pretzel? Wow, looks like I pulled a Homer!


Patrons: (MUMBLING, NOT IN UNISON) Happy thoughts... happy thoughts... we love that boy.
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Moe's Tavern. Hold on, I'll check. ... (LOUD) Hey everybody! I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face and a big butt, and my butt smells, and I like to kiss my own butt.
Barney_Gumble: That's a new one (LAUGHING).
Moe_Szyslak: Now wait a minute...


Homer_Simpson: Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes.
Moe_Szyslak: Why don't you go there first?
Homer_Simpson: Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?
Moe_Szyslak: Sorry, Homer.
Homer_Simpson: You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top.
Moe_Szyslak: Sorry, Homer.
Homer_Simpson: (LOOKING AT WATCH) Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare.
Little_Man: (CONCERNED) What's the matter, buddy?
Homer_Simpson: The moron next door closed early!
Little_Man: (STIFFENING) I happen to be that moron.
Homer_Simpson: Oh, me and my trenchant mouth.
Homer_Simpson: Please, you've got to open that store.
Little_Man: Let me think about it... Eh... No.
Homer_Simpson: Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. (GOES THROUGH HIS WALLET) Well I don't have one.
Moe_Szyslak: (TO LITTLE MAN) Come on, Jer. Open up. Be a pal. Remember when I pulled you and your wife out of that burning car?
Little_Man: (GRUDGINGLY) Okay. Okay. But now we're even. (TO HOMER) So what does your daughter need?
Homer_Simpson: (SMOOTHLY) I'll have you know, I wrote it down.
Homer_Simpson: Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!
Homer_Simpson: Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!
Little_Man: Uh-huh. And what instrument does she play?
Homer_Simpson: (SUNK) I dunno.


Moe_Szyslak: (TO PATRONS) Figure of speech.
Moe_Szyslak: Hiya, Homer. (SIGHS)
Homer_Simpson: What's the matter, Moe?
Moe_Szyslak: Ah, business is slow. People today are healthier and drinking less. You know, if it wasn't for the Junior High school next door no one would even use the cigarette machine.
Homer_Simpson: (MOUTH FULL) Yeah, things are tough all over.
Moe_Szyslak: Increased job satisfaction and family togetherness are poison for a purveyor of mind-numbing intoxicants like myself.
Homer_Simpson: Could I get a beer?
Moe_Szyslak: Uh, yeah, sure.
Moe_Szyslak: Oh sorry, I forgot we're out of beer.
Moe_Szyslak: Yeah, I know, I got behind on my beer payments. The distributor cut me off and I spent my last ten grand on the "Love Tester".
Moe_Szyslak: You're too late, Homer. Barney sucked it dry. Cut his gums up pretty bad.
Moe_Szyslak: Take it easy, Homer. I learned how to make other drinks at Bartender's School.
Moe_Szyslak: (UNFAMILIAR) Gin and... tonic? Do they mix?
Homer_Simpson: (BRIGHTENING) Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself...
Moe_Szyslak: Sorry, Harv.
Moe_Szyslak: Whoa, sounds like one hell of a drink. What do you call it?
Homer_Simpson: A "Flaming Homer".
Moe_Szyslak: Okay, why don't you make us up a couple of "Flaming Homers"?
Homer_Simpson: Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?
Moe_Szyslak: Uh, let me check the lost and found.
Moe_Szyslak: What do we got here, Bowie knife, troll doll, glass eye...
Moe_Szyslak: Oh. Here we are.
Moe_Szyslak: It's not without its charm.
Homer_Simpson: Try lighting it on fire.
Moe_Szyslak: (SMILING) Whoa! Homer, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
Larry: Hey, your Love Tester's busted. I want my nickel back. (COUGHS)
Moe_Szyslak: Hey, buddy. Have one on the house.
Larry: Hey, hey, this drink is delicious! And my phlegm feels looser. What do you call it?
Homer_Simpson: Well, it's called a "Flaming...
Moe_Szyslak: Moe! It's called a "Flaming Moe"! That's right, a "Flaming Moe". My name is Moe, and I invented it. That's why it's called a Flaming Moe. What? What are you lookin' at, Homer? It's a Flaming Moe I'm Moe.
Barney_Gumble: Hey, what's this?
Moe_Szyslak: A sneeze guard.
Barney_Gumble: Wow, it really works.
HARV: (CHUCKLING) I'll be back.
Homer_Simpson: Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?
Moe_Szyslak: Who can say? It's probably a combination of things.
Patron_#1: (TO MOE) Another pitcher of those amazing "Flaming Moe's".
Patron_#2: Boy, I hate this joint, but I love that drink.
Collette: Barkeep, I couldn't help noticing your sign.
Moe_Szyslak: The one that says, "Bartenders Do It 'Til You Barf"?
Collette: No, above that store-bought drollery.
Moe_Szyslak: Oh great! Why don't we fill out an application? (READING) I'll need your name, measurements and turn ons..
Collette: You really expect me to tell you my measurements?
Moe_Szyslak: You could, but I find this way is much more accurate... and fun.
Collette: (DISGUSTED) what do you offer in the way of salary?
Moe_Szyslak: Minimum wage and tips. (MEANINGFULLY) Of course there are fringe benefits.
Collette: Such as?
Moe_Szyslak: An unforgettable weekend at Club Moe.
Collette: I prefer to take my vacations someplace hot.
Moe_Szyslak: I like your moxie, kid. You're hired.
Collette: You shan't regret this.
Moe_Szyslak: Methinks I shan't.
HARV: (TO MOE) Pardon me, are you the genius behind the "Flaming Moe"?
Homer_Simpson: Why yes I --
Moe_Szyslak: (CUTTING HIM OFF) I'm your man.
HARV: Huh uh. My name is Harv Bannister. I work for "Tipsy McStagger's Good Time Drinking and Eating Emporium".
Moe_Szyslak: Oh yeah? Hey, what's Mr. McStagger really like?
HARV: Actually, there is no Tipsy McStagger. He's just a composite of other successful logos.
Moe_Szyslak: Well, you tell him from me that he makes one great mozzarella stick.
HARV: (QUICKLY) Yes, fine, I will. Anyway, I've got a proposition for you.
Moe_Szyslak: Keep talkin'.
HARV: We feel your "Flaming Moe" is perfect for our restaurant chain. We want to buy the recipe.
Moe_Szyslak: No dice. The "Flaming Moe" is not for sale. Do you know how much of my blood and sweat are in this drink?
Barney_Gumble: Good for you, Moe. Only an idiot would give away a million dollar idea like that.
Moe_Szyslak: (TO HARV) I'm sorry, but the secret ingredient dies with me.
Delivery_Man: (TO MOE) Thirty cases of cough syrup. Sign here.
Moe_Szyslak: (COVERING NERVOUS LAUGHING) I got hooked on this stuff in the service.
Homer_Simpson: (QUIETLY) Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?
Moe_Szyslak: Ah, she left to pursue a movie career. Frankly I think she was better off here.
Homer_Simpson: Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Moe_Szyslak: Oh, hey, hey. Maybe some things are too good to be kept a secret.
Homer_Simpson: I guess so.
Moe_Szyslak: Compliments of the house. (WARMLY) One "Flaming Homer".
Homer_Simpson: Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have.
Homer_Simpson: Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?
Moe_Szyslak: I doubt it.


Moe_Szyslak: (SHOCKED) Are you sure? Cuz once I open the bottle there's no refund.
Moe_Szyslak: Hey, Homer. Wanna Duff?
Homer_Simpson: (SMOOTHLY) No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve.
Homer_Simpson: For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy.
Homer_Simpson: Have a Duff, boys!
Hans: (GERMAN ACCENT, FRIENDLY) Oh, thank you. My English is not perfect, but I have to tell you your beer is like swill to us. Do I have that right? I am saying that only a swine would drink this beer.
Fritz: (GERMAN ACCENT) Yeah, but thank you anyway.
Homer_Simpson: Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?
Hans: Ech, nein. We are from Germany. He is from the East. I am from the West.
Fritz: I had a big company and he had a big company. Now we have a very big company.
Hans: We are interested in buying the power plant. Do you think the owner would ever sell it?
Homer_Simpson: (VERY CONFIDENT) Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars.
Fritz: A hundred million?
Hans: Oh, don't worry! We'll still have enough left to buy the Cleveland Browns.
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.
Bart_Simpson: (INTO PHONE) Uh yes, I'm looking for a Mrs. O'Problem. First name... Bee.
Moe_Szyslak: (INTO PHONE) Ah, yeah. Just a minute, I'll check. (CALLING OUT) Uh, Bee O'Problem. Bee O'Problem. C'mon, guys. Do I have an O'Problem here?
Barney_Gumble: You sure do!
Moe_Szyslak: (REALIZING) Awwww. (INTO PHONE) It's you, isn't it?
Moe_Szyslak: Listen you, when I get a hold of you, I'm gonna use your head for a bucket and paint my house with your brains!
Bart_Simpson: Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Moe_Szyslak: Wait a minute. I know that voice.
Moe_Szyslak: If it isn't little Bart Simpson! I haven't seen you in years.
Bart_Simpson: That's right. That's my pop!
Moe_Szyslak: Ah, little Bart... we hear all about your monkeyshines.
Moe_Szyslak: (CONSPIRATORIAL) Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he don't even know about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right?
Bart_Simpson: (CAN'T RESIST) Yeah, well, I make some crank phone calls.
Moe_Szyslak: (MUSSES BART'S HAIR) (LAUGHS) That's great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me?
Bart_Simpson: (A LITTLE EMBARRASSED) Moe, for you... anything?
Bart_Simpson: (SINGING) EVERY TEDDY BEAR WHO'S BEEN GOOD IS SURE OF A TREAT TODAY/ THERE'S LOTS OF MARVELOUS THINGS TO EAT, AND WONDERFUL GAMES TO PLAY/ BENEATH THE TREES, WHERE NOBODY SEES/ THEY'LL HIDE AND SEEK AS LONG AS THEY PLEASE/ TODAY'S THE DAY THE TEDDY BEARS HAVE THEIR PICNIC!
Moe_Szyslak: He's a pip, this one is!
C._Montgomery_Burns: Ah, the mirthless laugh of the damned. Hold your nose, Smithers, we're going in!
C._Montgomery_Burns: (TO SMITHERS) Watch me blend in. (TO MOE) Barkeep, some cheap domestic beer for me and my "buddy" here.
Homer_Simpson: I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!
C._Montgomery_Burns: Smithers, who is this saucy fellow?
Waylon_Smithers: Homer Simpson, sir. Sector Sieben-gruben -- I mean, Sector 7G. Recently terminated.
Homer_Simpson: That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.
Homer_Simpson: (POINTED) Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?
C._Montgomery_Burns: Yes.
Homer_Simpson: Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?
C._Montgomery_Burns: (SHAKEN) Why, no.
Homer_Simpson: And does it ever say, "I love you?"
C._Montgomery_Burns: (SHAKEN) No, it doesn't.
Homer_Simpson: (SING-SONG) Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!
Homer_Simpson: Nobody loves you...
C._Montgomery_Burns: Good heavens, Smithers! They're not afraid of me anymore!
Bart_Simpson: Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent?
C._Montgomery_Burns: Letter? I don't recall any letter...
Bart_Simpson: That's because I forgot to stamp it.
Moe_Szyslak: (LAUGHING) Ah, that kid slays me.
C._Montgomery_Burns: That was no accident. Let's get out of here.
Homer_Simpson: (SINGING) Na na na na / Na na na na /
Barflies: Hey hey hey / Goodbye -- Na na na na / na na na na / hey hey hey / goodbye...
C._Montgomery_Burns: What good is money if you can't inspire terror in your fellow man? (DETERMINED) I've got to get my plant back!
